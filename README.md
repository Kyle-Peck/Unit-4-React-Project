# DO NOT CODE SECTIONS

ALL OF THE PARTS THAT ARE COMMENTED OUT ARE THE TEACHER ANSWERS FOR THE STUDENT PROJECT AT THE

## Set Up

fix the SCSS formatter in the settings
/src/css/style.css

Add to the style sheet as you go.

- delete the files
  App.css
  index.css
  logo.svg
  setupTest.js
  App.test.js
- create the files
  style.scss

- delete the work in the App.js file
- create a container class in a div around all of your work
- update the scss file

.container{
max-width: 500px;
margin: 30px auto;
overflow: auto;
min-height: 300px;
border: 1px solid steelblue;
padding:30px;
border-radius: 5px;
}

## Intro to react

- add a smaller header in the app to show how it compiles and runs
- make sure to show errors and work though them
- talk about imports

## Intro to Components

- create a components folder
- create a Header.js file, this needs to be capitalized.
- add Header to your App.js, make sure you import it
- fill in the header
- make sure you mess around showing ternaries and arrow functions as much as needed

## Props

- This is the short work for properties
- props should ALWAYS be at the top level so that they can be used on other props

## Header

## Button

## Tasks

- this the container that will be used to map every task. it should go through the array of every task and pass it through

## Task // renamed to ListItem, task vs tasks were super confusing

- in order to use the FaTimes (font awesome mulitply "x") you to install react icons
- npm i react-icons

## useState

- install the extension called ES7 React/Redux ... by dsznajder

## DeleteTask

- added the delete task on app js and then passed i through the taks as an ondelete prop

# Student Project

## this is very hard but thats intentional

### frame it in professionalism, When they get their first job they are likely going to be asked to do something that they are not 100% comfortable with and they need to be able to stick with it and learn better.

- The students will be required to create an edit task section to the app.
- there are a lot of ways to get this done but here is 1 answer
